# Update 2023-07

## Staging servers

The jQuery Infrastructure team continued work to migrate all of jQuery's staging servers to the new infrastructure. Last month, this included the following:

https://stage.learn.jquery.com/ 
https://stage.api.jqueryui.com/ 
https://stage.jquery.com/ 
https://stage.releases.jquery.com/ 

These are the new staging servers that have been migrated to the new architecture:

https://stage.api.jquery.com/ 
https://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/ 
https://stage.brand.jquery.org/ 
https://stage.contribute.jquery.org/ 
https://stage.jquerymobile.com/ 
https://stage.jqueryui.com/ 
https://stage.meetings.jquery.org/

## Ensuring 2FA for all jQuery GitHub members

Timo reached out to several folks in the GitHub jQuery org that don't have 2FA enabled. 2FA is now enforced org-wide and thankfully no existing members lost access in the process.

## jQuery CDN

### New SSL certificate has been deployed

The SSL cert for *.jquery.com has been renewed, the most important cert for jQuery as that includes `code.jquery.com`. The old one expired on July 14, 2023. The process and its timeline have been documented in an issue on the private jQuery infrastructure repo.

### Tor

We're currently investigating reports that some users have been unable to access the jQuery CDN via Tor. However, the CDN will soon be migrated from StackPath to Fastly, which may end up resolving the issue.

## Decommissioning wp-01.stage

This droplet was 8 years old and was no longer used. We've transitioned all pointers to this droplet to the new infrastructure and have turned it off after 1 week.

## Profiling Traffic for Fastly

In preparation to migrate the CDN to Fastly from StackPath and at Fastly's request, we're putting together a doc that profiles jQuery's current CDN traffic. This will help Fastly determine the best configuration for our CDN. The doc is currently in progress.

## Modernizing jQuery Core's testing infrastructure

### Standalone test server

Most of jQuery's testing infrastructure works on karma, which has been [deprecated](https://blog.angular.io/moving-angular-cli-to-jest-and-web-test-runner-ef85ef69ceca?gi=f4883bb1048a). With Grunt also receiving minimal maintenance and with many of our tests running off an old Jenkins instance, this will mean a major refactor for jQuery Core's testing infrastructure. As a first step, the QUnit tests needed to run without any of those dependencies. This is now possible thanks to a new standalone test server written in Node that can be run locally. This will allow us to run tests manually until we've migrated to a new CI system.

### Grunt migration

The Core team has begun work to migrate all tasks run in Grunt to npm scripts. The first task to be migrated is `grunt lint` (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5297). In the process, we're also migrating the eslint config to use [the new configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new). The old configuration will be deprecated in the next major version of eslint.

There is currently one remaining blocker to complete the migration: [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import) does not yet support the new configuration format. We've [submitted a PR](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2829) that solves several issues, but some work remains to be done.
